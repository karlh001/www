To achieve this, the directory is encoded into 5 parts with 2 extra parts for redundancy, which means you only need 3 parts to restore.</p> <p>This may take longer to do, but file integrity is of the utmost importance and this project ensures that even with 2 missing parts, data can be restored; an excellent use case is to store across multiple cloud storage providers or regional buckets with the same cloud provider. I have stored my personal photos across two S3 regions. Each bucket does not need to have all files, therefore I have stored 3 in one and 3 in another; with one part stored in both (bucket_US: 0,1,2; bucket_EU: 2,3,4). </p> <p>Before:</p> <p></p> <p>After:</p> <p></p> <p>Original data remains intact.
